Kirinuki is a Golang library for storing small files over a plurality of storage targets, which aims to keep the content of files secret and realiable. Kirinuki provides a CLI too.

== How it handles storage

TBD

== How it handles encryption

TBD

== How it handles upload and download

When Kirinuki upload a file to the virtual storage, the data is encrypted and splitted into a number of chunks. Subsequently, Kirinuki uploads every single chunk to all possible storage targets. This ways is really hard (pratically impossible) to rebuild the original file from the scattered chunks of data, without Kirinuki and the master key.

== External libraries

Kirinuki requires few external libraries, among these the main one is https://github.com/graymeta/stow[STOW].
Indeed, Kirinuki completely relies on STOW for handling storage.

Kirinuki also needs https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus[LOGRUS] for logging and https://github.com/spf13/cobra[COBRA] for implementing the CLI.
